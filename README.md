# Basic Statistical Analysis Repository

This repository contains tasks and projects related to data analysis, statistical inference, and probability modeling. Below is an overview of the tasks performed:

## Tasks Performed

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Data inspection, cleaning, and visualization.
2. **Data Visualization**: Plotting distributions, relationships, and density functions.
3. **Kernel Density Estimation**: Estimating the PDF of data and selecting bandwidth.
4. **Probability Calculations**: Computing probabilities using PDF and CDF.
5. **Normal Distribution Analysis**: Working with normally distributed data.
6. **Feature Engineering**: Data transformation and preprocessing for machine learning.
7. **Modeling and Machine Learning**: Building, evaluating, and tuning machine learning models.
8. **Statistical Inference**: Conducting hypothesis tests and drawing conclusions.
